# Election_Forecasting_Model

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to developing and analyzing a predictive model for U.S. presidential election outcomes using polling data. It serves as a structured foundation for projects associated with Telling Stories with Data. The repository includes data simulation, cleaning, modeling, and documentation necessary to create a robust, reproducible election forecasting model. The key focus is on understanding how factors such as political affiliation, sample size, and candidate popularity influence election predictions. 

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/00-simulated_data` contains the simulated data.
-   `data/01-raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from 538 website.
-   `data/02-analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains details about LLM chat interactions and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, clean, model and test data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of ChatGPT. Some parts of paper were written with the help of ChatGPT and the entire chat history is available in `other/llm_usage/usage.txt`.
