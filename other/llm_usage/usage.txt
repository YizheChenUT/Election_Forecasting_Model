I have the downloaded data here. Can we proceed Building the Model?

ChatGPT
Yes! I recommend beginning with data cleaning and selecting variables for your model.

User
I chose one pollster YouGov for the sample. Could you update the code accordingly?

ChatGPT
Here’s the revised code for a single pollster dataset. This approach will help isolate your selected variables effectively.
#### Workspace setup ####
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

#### Clean data ####
raw_data <- read_csv("data/01-raw_data/raw_data.csv")

# Select relevant columns and clean names
cleaned_data <-
  raw_data |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>  # Clean column names to snake_case
  filter(pollster == "YouGov") |>  # Pick one pollster
  select(poll_id, pollster, candidate_name, pct, party, start_date, end_date, sample_size) |> 
  filter(!is.na(pct)) |>      # Filter out rows where percentage (pct) is missing
  mutate(
    party = case_when(
      party == "DEM" ~ "Democratic",
      party == "REP" ~ "Republican",
      TRUE ~ party    # Keep other parties unchanged
    ),
    candidate_name = as.factor(candidate_name),
    start_date = as.Date(start_date),  # Assuming start_date is in standard format
    end_date = mdy(end_date)  # If end_date is in "mm/dd/yyyy" format, adjust based on your data
  ) |> 
  arrange(start_date)          # Arrange data by the 'start_date'

I received an error regarding pollster_rating_name. How to solve?

ChatGPT
Since pollster_rating_name isn’t suitable, Please adjust the model with an alternative variable.

I received an error regarding pollster_rating_name. Can you recommend a replacement variable?

ChatGPT
Since pollster_rating_name isn’t suitable, I’ve adjusted the model with an alternative variable. Here’s the updated code with a new variable.

User
The model is complete. May I begin writing and documenting the Paper?

ChatGPT
Absolutely! Let’s start with the Abstract and Introduction based on the model results. Here’s an outline to guide you.
Abstract:
This paper presents a linear regression model that predicts the percentage of votes for presidential candidates based on polling data from YouGov. The model incorporates key predictors such as political party, candidate name, sample size, and polling end date. Our results show that both political party affiliation and sample size significantly affect the predicted vote share, with Republican candidates often receiving higher predicted percentages. This study highlights the importance of integrating candidate-specific and poll-specific factors to improve election forecasts, providing useful insights for political analysts and pollsters.
Introduction:
Polling data plays a critical role in shaping public opinion and forecasting election outcomes, particularly in democratic societies where political campaigns rely heavily on polls to gauge voter preferences. In the context of the U.S. presidential elections, the accuracy of poll-based predictions has become increasingly important for political parties, candidates, and media organizations. Despite the growing reliance on polling, there are several challenges in making accurate predictions, such as sample selection, timing of the poll, and candidate-specific factors.

This paper aims to build a predictive model using polling data from YouGov, one of the most recognized polling agencies, to forecast the percentage of votes for presidential candidates. The model incorporates variables such as political party, candidate name, sample size, and the poll's end date. By focusing on a single pollster, this study seeks to analyze the effect of these factors on vote share predictions and contribute to the broader literature on election forecasting.

The estimand of the model is the predicted percentage of votes that each candidate is expected to receive, which is influenced by the selected variables. Our findings suggest that both the political party of a candidate and the sample size of the poll significantly affect vote share predictions. These results are important as they provide valuable insights into how different factors influence the accuracy of polling predictions, potentially improving the quality of future election forecasts.

User
Please optimize the "Sample size" section. Here’s my preliminary text.

ChatGPT
Here’s an improved draft that integrates your text, along with added clarity on variables and measurement details.
Sample Size
An essential aspect of our data is the sample size, which varies across polls. Generally, larger sample sizes improve prediction reliability by capturing a broader spectrum of voter preferences, thereby reducing variability in vote share estimates. However, our findings reveal that after reaching a certain sample threshold, additional respondents do not significantly impact predicted vote percentages. This result, illustrated in @fig-sample-size, indicates a limited relationship between sample size and vote share predictions, with smaller sample sizes yielding similarly accurate predictions beyond a minimal threshold.

Despite this, the data shows that larger sample sizes can still reveal a wider range of voter preferences. This observation suggests that while increased sample size may not substantially affect the accuracy of the predicted vote share, it could enhance the model's ability to capture nuanced variations in voter opinion, which is particularly valuable in closely contested races where small differences matter.

User
Could you review my telegraphing paragraph for the Introduction?

ChatGPT
Here’s a refined version of the paragraph that aligns with the paper’s structure.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the data, including its sources, cleaning procedures, and key variables such as candidate name, political party, sample size, and polling end date. Section 3 discusses the model setup and justification, detailing the Bayesian linear regression approach and the reasoning behind choosing specific predictors to forecast vote share. Section 4 presents the results, offering insights into the impact of party affiliation, candidate identity, and other factors on predicted vote shares. Visualizations accompany these findings to illustrate key trends. Section 5 discusses the broader implications, limitations, and potential extensions of this study, including the influence of sample size and polling end date, as well as directions for future research. Finally, the Appendix includes a detailed analysis of YouGov’s polling methodology and an idealized methodology for conducting a survey with a $100K budget, offering practical insights for election forecasting.
